## ðŸ›’ E-Commerce Website Project

For this project, I set out to implement key features commonly found in modern e-commerce websitesâ€”such as:

- A dropdown menu  
- A shopping cart system  

At the time, I had just begun exploring **React.js**, but by the end, I had gained a solid understanding of **React components** and essential **React hooks**, particularly `useState` for managing interactivity and adding smooth animations on page load.

This project also gave me valuable practice with **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox**, both of which I used to craft a responsive and visually pleasing layout. My goal was to create a user-friendly experience that felt clean and intuitive.

One important principle I followed was optimizing image assets by scaling them down before use, rather than relying on CSS to resize themâ€”this significantly improved the projectâ€™s loading time and overall performance.
