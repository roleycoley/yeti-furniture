## ðŸ›’ E-Commerce Website Project

The main goal of this project was to learn how to create a **responsive web layout** that works seamlessly across different screen sizes. To make the learning process more engaging and practical, I chose to build a basic **e-commerce interface** that included features like:

- A dropdown navigation menu  
- A simple shopping cart system  

Along the way, I explored **React.js** for the first time, gaining a solid understanding of **components** and essential **hooks** like `useState`, which I used to manage interactivity and animate page elements.

I also used **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox** extensively to structure a layout that adapts cleanly to mobile and desktop views. One important principle I learned was to optimize image assets by scaling them down before use, rather than relying on CSS to resize them. This significantly improved loading times and overall site performance.
