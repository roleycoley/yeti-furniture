For this project, I had intended to implement typical things you would find in an ecommerce website, such as a dropdown menu, or a shopping cart system. I had just scratched the surface of React.js when I had started this project, but by the end of it, I had a good understanding of how React components worked, as well as the different React hooks I could use when making an app. On top of that, I had some great practice with CSS grid and CSS flexbox. 

I aimed to make this website aesthetically pleasing while providing the user with a smooth experience. I also played with React's useState hook in order to make the site more interactive, as well as add a small animation when the project first loads.

An important principle that had stuck out to me was to scale my images down so CSS does not have to, which increases the loading time of my project significantly.
